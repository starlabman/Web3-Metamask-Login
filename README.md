I am an application developer, I do back-end and front-end programming, and server configuration and management. I hesitate to say "full stack developer", a term popularized some time ago, which has become controversial.

My job is therefore to create products for the web: it can range from a simple showcase page to a web application. I can wear several hats for the same project, from the client's specifications to the design and modeling, including the development of the APIs (Application Programming Interface) in the back-end, the creation of the pages with the integration of the design, or take care of setting up the system and/or servers. Without forgetting on-site referencing (SEO) and visibility during the project (Social network management). I am interested in web3 with the arrival of Bitcoin (peer to peer transaction), Blockchain (block chains), NFTs (non-fungible tokens), metaverses etc. Mint site and develops crypto and NFT projects.
